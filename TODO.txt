TODO
====
1. Fix video encoding
2. Fix Panorama mode preview
3. Wi-Fi hotspot tethering - p2p_supplicant needs adding
4. Figure out how stock gets the network display name (any remaining SIM issues will have to be verified through a released build)
5. Capacitive key lights behaving odd -- try stock liblights
6. Use stock android gadget driver?
7. Fix adbd switching off through boot up (needs enabling manually in developer options on an eng build).
