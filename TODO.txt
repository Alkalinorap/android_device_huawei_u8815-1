TODO
====

1. Hack up audio again (shouldn't be too hard, only disabled because I couldn't be bothered a month ago).
2. Investigate Bluetooth, I don't think we ever had it working.
3. Look in to USB weirdness, potentially tidy up some of the USB modes.
4. General clean up.
5. RIL. *shivers*
6. Camera (lol).
