TODO
====

1. Fix mobile data and test RIL to the death (now using QualcommSharedRIL).
1. Decide which is the best Bluetooth method and pursue it.
2. Look in to USB weirdness, potentially tidy up some of the USB modes (half way through first boot adbd switches off, killing logcat, etc).
3. General clean up.
5. Camera (lol).
