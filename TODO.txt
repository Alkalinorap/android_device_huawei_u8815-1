TODO
====
1. Figure out how stock gets the network display name (any remaining SIM issues will have to be verified through a released build)
2. Fix adbd switching off through boot up (needs enabling manually in developer options on an eng build).
3. Look at Panorama mode preview
4. OMX
5. Capacitive key lights behaving odd -- try stock liblights
6. Use stock android gadget driver?
